// Package amiibo is an unofficial Nintendo SDK for the Go programming language.
//
// The amiibo SDK provides tools that developers can use to explore the Amiibo products
// on offer from Nintendo.
//
// The SDK is designed to remove the complexity of coding directly against the Nintendo Amiibo website
// and resolving the unification of data collected from the Nintendo CDN.
//
// The SDK also includes helpful utilities on top of the core struct layers that add additional
// capabilities and functionality. For example, the amiibo/mux package provides a
// basic HTTP mux interface that can be extended and hosted on an public service.

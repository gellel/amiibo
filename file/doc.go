// Package file is a basic io handler for writing amiibo content across the package.
//
// File handles the creation, removal and checking of files
// across the package in an effort to provide a single touchpoint
// for folder creation.
//
// File is implemented by amiibo/amiibo, amiibo/compatability,
// amiibo/game, and amiibo/lineup to offer some out of the box functionality
// to store the large volumn of JSON collected into a reliable
// structure for repeated use.
